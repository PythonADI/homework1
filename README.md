# Assignment 1


1. Given 2 variables `first_name` and `last_name`, write a program that creates a new variable `full_name` and assigns it the value of the full name of the person. Print the value of `full_name`. What type of data type is the value of `full_name`?
2. Given the variable `age`, write a program that prints the value of `age` in the following format: `You are 20 years old`. What type of data type is the value of `age`?
3. Given the variable `temperature`, write a program that prints the value of `temperature` in the following format: `The temperature is 20.3 degrees`. What type of data type is the value of `temperature`?
4. Using `temperature` variable, create a new variable called `is_hot` and assign it a boolean value based on the value of `temperature`. Print the value of `is_hot`. What type of data type is the value of `is_hot`? (let's assume that if the temperature is greater than 30 degrees, it's hot) what type of data type is the value of `is_hot`?
5. Explain the difference between the following data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`. Give examples of each data type.
